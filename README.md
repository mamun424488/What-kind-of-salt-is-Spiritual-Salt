## What is Spiritual Salt?

**Spiritual Salt** is a product typically made from pure mineral-rich salt crystals, often sourced from ancient salt mines. These crystals are **charged with spiritual energy** through specific rituals or environmental exposure (like moonlight or sacred spaces). Unlike ordinary salt used in cooking or bathing, Spiritual Salt is used for **energetic and symbolic purposes**.

It's not a supplement or food product, but rather a metaphysical tool meant to be carried, displayed, or placed in a living space for its energetic effects.
